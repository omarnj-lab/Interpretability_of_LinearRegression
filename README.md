# Interpretability_of_LinearRegression
it provides a basic information about the interpretability of Linear Regression Algorithm by using python.

**Interpretability of ML models is a new trend to explain these models to human to make them understand why a certain prediction is occured.. This is a part of XAI**

In this project, we will learn the following: 
* Linear Regeession Theory.
* How to implement Linear regression in Python.
* Linear Regression Interpretability.

**Linear Regression Theory:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the supervised Machine Learning Algorithms is Linear Regression which is used for Regression and Classification. Linear Regression Model expresses the linear relation 
between one or more variables. If Te dataset is in 2-Dimensional Space the result would be a stragiht line. If the data set in 3-D space, the result would be a plane. 

Rhe equation of simple Linear Regression Model is as following  **y = mx + b** 
where the y is the dependent varaible, x is the independent varaible, m is the solope and b is the intercept.

So bacially,  Linear Regression Model attempts to give the most optimal value for the intercept and slop in 2-d spac and returns the line with the leaset error.

**How to implement Linear regression in Python.**

Our problem is take from https://stackabuse.com/linear-regression-in-python-with-scikit-learn/ that simply represents the simplest linear regression model 
where we deal with number of hour that students studies and their perecenteges of marks that a certain student score in certain exam. 
The goal of this project is by giving a number of hours, how high score can the student acheive? 

The code of this project could be found in the shared link and in this github. 


Note : check the Linear Regression Interpretability file for more details on how to interpret such a model.
