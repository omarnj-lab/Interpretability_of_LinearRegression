# Linear Regression Interpretability

Before we go into some explaiantion of our predicted values in this project , let talk abouts some features about what makes the interpretation of Linear Regression quiet simple: 

1. Linearity
The linear regression model forces the prediction to be a linear combination of features. Linearity leads to interpretable models. 
Linear effects are easy to quantify and describe. They are additive, so it is easy to separate the effects. 

2. Normality
It is assumed that the target outcome given the features follows a normal distribution. If this assumption is violated, 
the estimated confidence intervals of the feature weights are invalid.

3. Independence
It is assumed that each instance is independent of any other instance.

4.Fixed features
The input features are considered "fixed". Fixed means that they are treated as "given constants" and not as statistical variables. 
This implies that they are free of measurement errors.

Now, we will try to interpret our model by using simple code without moving to some XAI techniques or other complex methods. 

Let's show some of the output that we got from the code: 

1. Output of the Model: 

      Actual      	Predicted
	20	        16.884145
	27	        33.732261
	69	        75.357018
	30	        26.794801
 	62	        60.491033
  
2. if we apply print(regressor.intercept_)
    - The resulting value you see should be approximately 2.01816004143.

3. if we apply print(regressor.coef_)
    - The result should be approximately 9.91065648.
   
Now , putting everything togather and to able to answer one question: 
**How these results come out and to interpret them?**

Simply, we can use the following code 

      Model = sm.Ols(y_train,X_train).fit()
      print(Model.summary) 
      
 we can notice the coeffiencts of our only one variable "hours" is approximately 9.91065648 which tells us This means that for every one unit of change in hours studied, 
 the change in the score is about 9.91%. Or in simpler words, if a student studies one hour more than they previously studied for an exam,
 they can expect to achieve an increase of 9.91% in the score achieved by the student previously.
 
 So, in Linear Regression Models, the coeffiencts can provide could meaning why and how such predicted value is came out. This is still a very simple way to interpret and alot of 
 techniques and methods could be used to interpret our model.
 
 we can also depends on other values to interpret our model. we could also do the following: 
  - We can plot the coefficient’s values and standard errors. Start by computing an error term equal to the difference between the parameter’s value and the lower confidence 
 interval bound for this parameter, and build a single table with the coefficient, the error term and the name of the variable.
 
 By this work , we could done a simple step to explain why a certain model results in this prediction values.. moreover could be improved to explain more about our data and model.
